# Store-Location-Prediction-using-K-Means-Clustersing
The aim of this project is to implement a Store location Predictor. 
We create a dummy dataset for our implementation and apply a K Means Clustering algorithm.
The number of new store to open in a area depends upon the number of clusters we initialize in our K Means Clustering algorithm.
